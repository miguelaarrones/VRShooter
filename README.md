# VRShooter
A VR Shooter testing game.

## This project is not finished, there's a lot of polishment to be done and is not working as a properly shooter. 

VR Shooter shows:
- How I implemented all the necessary to make a Unity game run in VR
- Movement and turn providers
- Direct interactors
- Hand presence and animations
- Events for the direct interactor in C#
- Simple shooting **(Not finished)**
- Simple Enemy AI **(Not finished)**
